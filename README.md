## App Description
SMSPay is an app that facilitates SMS-based payment system, allowing users to send money to other phone numbers. Instead of needing an internet connection, the app would rely mainly on low-data SMS messages.

### How it works
- The client application sends AES-128 encrypted transactions requests to the SMS gateway client.
- The gateway app would then receive this message it, then send it to our Node.js server using REST APIs.
- The Node.js server will process the request by checking the mysql server which hosts the data. Then it replies with either confirmation, or a certain error to the gateway app.
- The gateway app would finally forward the server response to the requested phone using an SMS.

### SMS-Based App Features
- **Send Payment**: allows the user to input a phone number and desired amount of money to be sent. The user also has the option to choose to pay to a group, and in that case they will have to input the group name which they already created.
-  **Groups**: the user is able to create a group, give it a name, then enter multiple phone numbers to be participants of that group. This offers convenience for users that make recurrent payments to a certain set of phone numbers.
-  **QR Generation**: the user can press the QR button on the balance tab in order to generate a QR code image holding their phone number.
- **Invoice QR Generation**: the user can input the amount of money that they want to invoice, and then the app would generate a QR image that holds their phone number, and the entered amount.
- **QR Scanner**: this allows the user to scan the QR codes generated by other users on their SMSPay.

### Internet-Based App Features
- **Transaction List**: the app allows the user to see their recent transactions, including the timestamp, the other phone number, and the amount of the transaction.
- **Groups List**: the user can view their created groups, including all the phone numbers within then list.
